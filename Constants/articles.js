      '"Looking to Get Lost: Adventures in Music and Writing", by Peter Guralnick.  (Little, Brown and Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, Inc.; NY, October, 2020)',

    description: `Michael “Mudcat” Ward is listed in the Index for pages 132, 195-196. These pages are a part of chapter 10, entitled "Dick Curless: The Return of the Tumbleweed Kid”
        Here’s a passage from PAGE 132, describing the beginnings of the project to record Dick Curless, which became the Rounder CD Traveling Through:<br><br>
        “This is how it came about.<br>
        Earlier that year Jake and I had produced an album by Sleepy LaBeef (it's a long story, but Jake produced: I was along for the ride), with our friend Bob Kempf engineering. It turned out to be a wonderfully shared musical moment bursting with energy and creativity, and in its aftermath, Michael “Mudcat” Ward, the bass player in the band that Jake had put together for the session, suggested to Jake: Why not reassemble the group and cut an album on Dick Curless, whom Mudcat, a native of Lewiston, Maine, knew through the New England country music circuit? Totally by happenstance, or then again maybe not, Dick got in touch with Rounder Records, where Jake worked, at just about this time. Jake heard an announcement over the intercom that Dick Curless was on the line for Ken Irwin, one of Rounder’s owners, and took it as a sign.” (Pg. 132)<br><br>
        
    “Soon everyone had nicknames. Duke (Levine) was Duke-Do to Dick’s own occasional Dickie-Do. The bass player, Mudcat, was already Mudcat, of course, and Denny (Breau), like his brother before him, became Sonny." (Pg. 195)<br><br>
        
        “The drummer and bass player, Billy Conway and Mudcat Ward, do not see themselves as soloists, and even the guitarists and steel player seem a little taken aback. But Dick is not about to give up. ‘Just give me what’s in there,’ Dick coaxes them. “Oh, that’s good,’ he says encouragingly to each of the players in turn, and while the song is actually being recorded, there is a point of such stillness, a moment of such utter lostness and tranquility, that it makes you want to cry.” (Pg. 196)

      `"Michael “Mudcat” Ward is listed in the Index for pages 145 and 189, and I am mentioned additionally on page 192.<br><br>

      Here’s a passage from Chapter 6 relating to the making of Hubert Sumlin’s Blues Party (Blacktop #1036LP, 1987):<br><br>
      
      "The label trusted (Ronnie) Earl’s vision, and under his guidance Hubert was soon engulfed by the region’s best musicians. On tap were drummer extraordinaire John Rossi (dubbed 'Father Time' because of his steady, in-the-pocket feel), piano ace and touring/studio vet (David) Maxwell, harp man Jerry Portnoy  (formerly with Muddy Waters), blues ace of bass Michael “Mudcat” Ward, and virtually the rest of the entire Roomful of Blues crew (Ron Levy on piano/keyboard, Greg Piccolo on tenor sax, Doug James on baritone sax, and Bob Enos on trumpet). (Pg. 145)<br><br>
      
      Here’s a passage from Chapter 8 relating to the making of About Them Shoes (Tone-Cool/Artemis #51609, 2005):<br><br>
      
      “It was settled: (Eric) Clapton and (Keith) Richards were in, and soon a stellar cast of musicians was invited to participate: guitarist Bob argon, harpist/guitarist Paul Oscher, pianist David Maxwell, harpist James Cotton, vocalist David Johansen, drummer Levon Helm, drummer/vocalist George Receli, vocalist/bassist Nathaniel Peterson, bassist Michael “Mudcat” Ward, and others. The project was then given a name: About Them Shoes… “ (Pg. 189)<br><br>
      
      “”’That was a fun rhythm section, Mudcat on bass,’ says (Levon) Helm, who played with Muddy as part of The Band’s The Last Waltz production. ‘We just tried to support Hubert’s fills and flavoring We all got around Hubert and made up the rhythm section.’” (Pg 192)
